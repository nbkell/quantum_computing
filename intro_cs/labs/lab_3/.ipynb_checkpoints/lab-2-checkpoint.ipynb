    "Consider a scenario where we want to store a collection of numbers that has several duplicates, but the number of elements in the list is too large to store directly in memory. Therefore instead of storing the entire list, we instead decide to maintain a frequency table of its elements, represented as a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the original list was <code>L = [1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 5, 5, 4, 1, 1]</code>, we would now represent\n",
    "the list as the following dictionary: <code>LFreq = {1:4, 3:1, 2:2, 5:2, 4:1}</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this setup, write a function <code>average(LFreq)</code> that takes in the <code>LFreq</code> representation of the list <code>L</code> and returns its average. \n",
    "\n",
    "<i> Important: Again, assume your code is intended for a list L that is too big to store directly in memory. You will receive little credit if your solution first \"recreates\" the standard representation of L in order to solve the problem. </i>"

    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will write a function that uses an example encoded/decoded message to decode an encoded secret message.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, as input the function is given two strings <code>exampleEncoded</code> and <code>exampleDecoded</code>\n",
    "where the former is the encoded version of the latter. \n",
    "Additionally, you are given a secret encoded message <code>mysteryEncoded</code> (which your function is tasked with decoding). Furthermore, you can assume that the encoding scheme simply uses a 1-to-1 correspondence between characters. \n",
    "Therefore, looking at <code>exampleEncoded</code>, we can see which characters they map to in\n",
    "<code>exampleDecoded</code> and then use this mapping to directly decipher <code>mysteryEncoded</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose <code>exampleEncoded</code> and <code>exampleDecoded</code> are <code>\"rovvyley!vnj\"</code> and <code>\"hello world!\"</code>, respectively, and our secreted encoded message is <code>\"eyej\"</code>. \n",
    "Then, looking at our examples, we can see that <code>\"e\"</code> maps to <code>\"w\"</code> (the 7th characters of each respectively), and therefore the first and third characters in the secret message must decode to be <code>\"w\"</code>. \n",
    "Similarly, we can see that <code>\"y\"</code> maps to <code>\"o\"</code>, and <code>\"j\"</code> maps to <code>\"!\"</code>. Therefore, the secret message once decoded is <code>\"wow!\"</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function <code>secretMessage(exampleEncoded, exampleDecoded, mysteryEncoded)</code>\n",
    "that returns the string that is <code>mysteryEncoded</code> once deciphered. \n",
    "You may assume all characters that appear in the mystery decoded string also appear in <code>exampleDecoded</code>\n",
    "(otherwise, you would not have enough information to completely decipher the message). \n",
    "\n",
    "<i>(Hint: Use the strings <code>exampleEncoded</code> and <code>exampleDecoded</code> to create a dictionary that maps characters in a encoded string to their corresponding characters in a decoded string. Then use your dictionary to decode <code>mysteryEncoded</code>.)</i>"
