    "Suppose you want to calculate your *average net savings* in the months of June, July, and August, where net savings in a given month is your total earnings minus your total expenses. \n",

    "Additionally, write a <code>main()</code> function where you test your implementation of <code>average_net_savings()</code> for different earnings/expenses amounts for June, July, and August. Also be sure to write a docstring for your <code>average_net_savings()</code> function. Format your code in a similar way as the examples covered previously in the week. "

    "\n",
    "Manny Manhattan and Ulysses Euclid have both decided to go for a walk in Gridwalk Park. The park is oriented so that each respective side runs parallel to the north-south and east-west axses. Furthermore, throughout the park, sidewalks have been evenly placed along both its width and length so that they form a \"sidewalk grid\", where adjacent parallel sidewalks are 10 meters apart. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can think of the southwest corner as corresponding to the point (0,0), and the intersection of each sidewalk as corresponding to a point on the plane, where the coordinate of each point is a multiple of 10. For example, starting from the southwest corner and walking over one intersection to the east and then one intersection to the north would bring someone to the intersection corresponding to point (10,10). \n",
    "\n",
    "When walking through Gridwalk, Manny and Ulysses have different methods for traversing through the park. Manny prefers to always walk on the sidewalks, whereas Ulysses will cut through the grass and take a direct route to his destination. Therefore, Manny always covers at least as much ground as Ulysses when traveling to and from the same intersections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a function called <code>distance_difference(xstop1, ystop1, xstop2, ystop2)</code> that outputs how much farther Manny will travel than Ulysses if they both start their walks at the southwest corner of Gridwalk, travel to the intersection corresponding to the point <code>(xspot1, yspot1)</code>, and then travel to the intersection at the point <code>(xstop2, ytop2).</code> \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, write a <code>main()</code> function that calls your <code>distance_difference()</code> function for various combinations of stop 1 and stop 2 points and then prints the results.   Also, be sure to write a docstring for your <code>distance_difference()</code> function. Format your code in a similar way as the examples covered previously in the week. \n",
